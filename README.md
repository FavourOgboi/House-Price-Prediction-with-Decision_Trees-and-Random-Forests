## Project Overview  
1. **Step 1**: Download and explore the dataset.  
2. **Step 2**: Prepare the dataset for training.  
3. **Step 3**: Train decision tree and random forest models.  
4. **Step 4**: Make predictions and evaluate the models.  

We will use the dataset from Kaggle's **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** competition. Complete the notebook by replacing the placeholders (`???`) with the appropriate code.
